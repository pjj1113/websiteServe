            Aim and Scope<br/>
            Food, Environment and Public Health (FEH) is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that publishes original articles, reviews, research notes, and essays in the interdisciplinary fields of food safety, environmental health sciences, and public health. It integrates biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, molecular biology, chemistry, computer science, ecology, engineering, epidemiology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, oncology, pathology, pharmacology and toxicology together to solve key issues related to food safety, environmental quality and public health. Therefore, FEH is committed to publishing scientific and technical information about the impact of natural phenomena and human factors on environmental quality, the relationship between environmental health and quality of life, and the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic aspects, as well as legal considerations related to food tests, environmental medicine and public health. As a comprehensive multidisciplinary journal, FEH is composed of 20 main parts, including the following:
            food safety and security;<br/>
            food nutrition and health;<br/>
            interaction between genes and the environment; <br/>
            global environmental health; <br/>
            ecotoxicology and ecological risk assessment and management; <br/>
            environmental chemistry and computational models; <br/>
            environmental education and public health; <br/>
            environmental engineering and technology; <br/>
            environmental epidemiology and disease control; <br/>
            environmental genomics and proteomics; <br/>
            environmental geology and health; <br/>
            environmental health and disease; <br/>
            environmental medicine; <br/>
            environmental policy and management; <br/>
            environmental toxicology, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis; <br/>
            health risk assessment and management; <br/>
            natural resource damage assessment and management.<br/>
            The journal emphasizes a holistic approach and will be a comprehensive multidisciplinary platform dedicated to solving important public health problems related to food safety and security environmental pollution and degradation.
